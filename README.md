# Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing sales data. The project involves loading sales data from a CSV file, exploring the dataset, cleaning the data, performing data analysis, visualizing the results, and drawing conclusions based on the insights gained.

## Project Structure

- `sales_data.csv`: CSV file containing the sales data.
- `sales_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for the data analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The sales data is loaded from the `sales_data.csv` file using the Pandas library.
2. **Data Exploration**: Basic exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure and contents.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values in the dataset are identified and dropped to ensure data integrity.
4. **Data Analysis**: Various analyses are conducted, including calculating total sales amount, sales by product category, and sales distribution across different regions.
5. **Data Visualization**: The analysis results are visualized using bar plots and pie charts to provide clear insights.
6. **Conclusion**: Key insights from the analysis are summarized, and recommendations may be provided based on the findings.

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `sales_data_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the code in the notebook to load the data, perform analysis, and visualize the results.
